Leaderboards Gideros client
===========================

Client for leaderboards server https://github.com/romka/leaderboards-server based on Gideros framework. To use these server and client you need to install leaderboards-server on your own hosting. I ran leaderboards-server on my host kece.ru (ports 10188, 10189) to illustrate how client and server works, but this server must be used only for testing purposes.
